This is a cookiecutter template for creating new QIIME 2 plugins.
To learn how to use this, refer to the Plugin Development Tutorial in [*Developing with QIIME 2*](https://cap-lab.bio/developing-with-qiime2).

The original version of this plugin was derived from the [@misialq's plugin template](https://github.com/bokulich-lab/q2-plugin-template).

Happy developing!
